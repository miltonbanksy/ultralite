                <ul>
                    <li><b>The Leader</b> You're good at bringing people together and identifying their strengths and weaknesses. You add +2 instead of +1 when you help someone by telling them what you think one of their strengths is.</li>
                    <li><b>The Techie</b> You have a ham radio, extra walkie-talkies, a camera, or maybe even a computer. When you use a piece of tech to do something you couldn't do otherwise, add +1 to your roll.</li>
                    <li><b>The Bookworm</b> You're the smart one of your group, probably quiet, probably always with your nose in a book. Add +1 to any roll you make to do research or recall information about something.</li>
                    <li><b>The Rebel</b> You don't play by anyone's rules but your own. You're a troublemaker and you don't often play well with others. Add +1 to any roll you make to steal, trespass, sneak out of your house, or otherwise break a major rule.</li>
                    <li><b>The Charmer</b> You're a smooth-talker, possibly the class clown and probably a really good liar. Add +1 to any roll you make to lie, distract someone, or convince someone of something.</li>
                    <li><b>The Athlete</b> You're in good health and good shape and probably have a lot of energy. Add +1 to any rolls you make that require physical exertion, such as fighting or running away.</li>
                    <li><b>The Scout</b> You are a girl scout or boy scout, or maybe you've just read the books or been trained by someone else in survival skills. Add +1 to any rolls you make that have to do with surviving in the wild, such as starting a fire, scavenging for food, or following tracks</li>
                    <li><b>The Baby</b>  You're the youngest or smallest of the group, probably someone's baby brother or sister. Add +1 when you ask an adult for help or resources, or when you try to squeeze into a place that isn't easily accessible.</li>
                    <li><b>The Weirdo</b> You don't have a lot of friends. Maybe you're new, or you just have a hard time getting along with other people, but the way your mind works is different somehow. Add +1 when you roll to see what's out of place, find strange things, or sense when something's wrong.</li>
                    <li><b>The Freak</b> You're something strange and unusual. Maybe you were born with special powers, or you're an escaped government experiment or an alien. Whatever you are, you have a weird ability, like telekinesis, telepathy, future-sight, or animal mind control. Work with your GM to determine what it is you can do that no one else can. When you use your special ability, add +1 to your roll.</li>

                <p class="indent">Choose two subjects that your character is really interested in or thinks is cool, and could talk about all day, like monster movies, comic books, music, chemistry, soccer, astronomy, or sewing. When you roll and can describe how one of your interests might help you, add +1.</p>

                <summary class="indent2">Rumors</summary>

                <summary class="indent2">Hideout</summary>
                <p class="indent">Your hideout might be in someone's bedroom or basement, a treehouse, a fort in the woods, a cave system, an abandoned cabin, or anything else you can think of that no one else but you uses. Choose up to three boons and at least two drawbacks.</p>
            </details>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary class="indent">Risky Rolls</summary>
            <pre>Whenever you want to do something risky, roll 2d6, plus
any modifiers you may have.

● A 2-6 is a failure. The player describes what goes wrong
and the GM describes how things get worse somehow.

● A 7-9 is a partial success or a success with a
complication. You barely succeed and the GM will give
you a cost or a complication. If you don't wish to accept
the cost or complication, you can choose to fail instead.

● A 10-12 is a full success. You do what you want and do it
well.

● A 13+ is a critical success. The GM offers you +1d6 on
your next roll or some other extra benefit.

Main themes of the game are friendship, teamwork,
exploration, discovery, secrecy, communication, and the
fear of growing up. When a character wants to help
another character to add +1 to their roll, that character
must speak on one of these themes in character along with
explaining how their character helps. Only one +1 can be
added no matter how many people help (unless the leader
is helping, in which case +2 is added).</pre>

            <ul>
                <li>What natural laws apply?</li>
                <li>Is magic real? Are gods real? Are horrors real? Do they interfere in the world and how?</li>
                <li>What is the state of technology?</li>
                <li>What do Adventurers know of things in the world? How much can they learn and discover?</li>
                <li>How do most beings react when meeting others?</li>
                <li>How much does class, status, ancestry etc. matter in character interactions?</li>
                <li>How well can baseline Adventurers handle themselves in combat? How grim is it?</li>
                <li>How much strain can Adventurers handle?
                <li>What does it take to recover?</li>
            </ul>
            * Make Truths hard on the adventureres.
            <br>
            * Hardship makes for good stories.
            <h3>Adventurer Truths (examples)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Where are they from?</li>
                <li>What do they want?</li>

                <li>What do they carry?</li>
                <li>How do they look?</li>
                <li>What's their name?</li>
            </ul>
            * Adventurers grow when they confront and overcome troubles.
            <br>
            * These are moments to update their Truths.
            <h3>Truth...</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Adventurers describe what they do, think, and feel.</li>
                <li>The World reacts and reveals.</li>
                <li>Act and react according to Truths.</li>
                <li>If in doubt what the Truths dictate, discuss, expand, even add, edit or delete Truths. The Truthsayer has the final verdict.</li>
                <li>If in doubt whether something is the Truth, state your idea of a Truth and roll a six-sided die:
                    <ul>
                        <li>1-2:  No, the Truth is almost the opposite.</li>
                        <li>3-4: Almost, but there is a twist. What is it?</li>
                        <li>5-6: That is the truth.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>... or Dare?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Sometimes Adventurers may attempt to defy a Truth by calling for a Dare.</li>
                <li>Perhaps they don’t want to accept the price they have to pay for overcoming a certain challenge. Perhaps they believe their actions should have a greater effect. Perhaps they simply think it’s time for heroics!</ul>
                <li>When a Dare is called for, consider what might go wrong can it go, and what could go well. Let Truths inform the deliberation.</li>
                <li>Then, roll one six-sided die and interpret what the rolls means. The Truthsayer has the final say:
                    <ul>
                        <li>1-3: Things go wrong.</li>
                        <li>4-6: Things go well.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            * Now, back to the Truths. Until you Dare again.
