            * Adventurers grow when they confront and overcome troubles.
            <br>
            * These are moments to update their Truths.
            <h3>Truth...</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Adventurers describe what they do, think, and feel.</li>
                <li>The World reacts and reveals.</li>
                <li>Act and react according to Truths.</li>
                <li>If in doubt what the Truths dictate, discuss, expand, even add, edit or delete Truths. The Truthsayer has the final verdict.</li>
                <li>If in doubt whether something is the Truth, state your idea of a Truth and roll a six-sided die:
                    <ul>
                        <li>1-2:  No, the Truth is almost the opposite.</li>
                        <li>3-4: Almost, but there is a twist. What is it?</li>
                        <li>5-6: That is the truth.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>... or Dare?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Sometimes Adventurers may attempt to defy a Truth by calling for a Dare.</li>
                <li>Perhaps they don’t want to accept the price they have to pay for overcoming a certain challenge. Perhaps they believe their actions should have a greater effect. Perhaps they simply think it’s time for heroics!</ul>
                <li>When a Dare is called for, consider what might go wrong can it go, and what could go well. Let Truths inform the deliberation.</li>
                <li>Then, roll one six-sided die and interpret what the rolls means. The Truthsayer has the final say:
                    <ul>
                        <li>1-3: Things go wrong.</li>
                        <li>4-6: Things go well.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            * Now, back to the Truths. Until you Dare again.
